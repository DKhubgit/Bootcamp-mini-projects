# Bootcamp-mini-projects
After completing the bootcamp, creating a collection of mini projects! The goal is to review each concepts learned through the coding bootcamp and apply the skills. Also to gain new perspectives by going back to foundational concepts/skills and solidifying those skills now that I have full exposure to web development.
